        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. 
                Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made 
                drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did 
                have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had 
                nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she 
                spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the 
                neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their 
                opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. </p>
